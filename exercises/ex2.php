I see different problems:
1) Using '@' operator we are hiding all errors, this is a bad practice
2) the function 'str_pad("Server is $host ($user / $pass)", 0, 50)' is not doing anything.
3) the function 'ftp_fput($conn, $upload_from, $upload_to, FTP_ASCII)' is wrongly used, since the 2ยบ argument should be '$upload_to' and not '$upload_from'; besides, the 3rd argument should be a pointer to the opened file, such as 'fopen($upload_from)' not just a string of the path.
4) With every file we want to upload, we are stucking the execution for 1-2 minutes, so this is very innefficient; halting the server for too long.


The sollutions I would give are:
1) Remove '@' operator
2) Removing the function str_pad() or change the arguments with, for example: 'str_pad("Server is $host ($user / $pass)", 50, "_", STR_PAD_BOTH)' which will and an underscore on both sides of the given string until the number of total caracters of the new string is equal to 50.
3) & 4) I would directly change the function 'ftp_fput()' to either 'ftp_nb_fput($conn, $upload_to, fopen($upload_from), FTP_ASCII)' or  'ftp_nb_put($conn, $upload_to, $upload_from, FTP_ASCII)' ; to make asynchronous upload to the FTP server and the execution of the program wont be waiting 1-2 mins for every website is updating
